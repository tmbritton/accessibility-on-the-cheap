First rule of ARIA use
“If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behaviour you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.” – Using ARIA, W3C (https://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/)
